# Changelog
I like [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), so this project conforms to it as best I'm willing and able.

## [v0.1.0]
* [feature] [Switching from DynamoDB to PostgreSQL](https://github.com/Ubunfu/page-flipper/pull/2)
* [feature] [Switching from bcrypt to Argon2id, and supporting Redis session storage](https://github.com/Ubunfu/page-flipper/pull/3)
